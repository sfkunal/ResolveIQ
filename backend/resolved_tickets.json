By verifying the system status and checking the queue configuration, we should be able to identify the cause of the issue.\n2. The toggle of John's availability will help reset the auto-assignment process and generate a new assignment for him.\n3. After toggling availability and manually refreshing John's status, he should receive a new assignment if the issue is resolved.\n\n**Employee Attribute Impact:**\n\n* By toggling John's availability from \"Available\" to \"Not Available\", we are helping to reset the auto-assignment process and generate a new assignment for him.\n* The system will consider his updated availability when generating assignments in the future, ensuring that similar issues are not encountered.",
